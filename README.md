# LaneDetect-Road-Lane-Detection-System
Python project using OpenCV for road lane detection. Enables driver assistance with accurate identification of lane boundaries, crucial for safe navigation in autonomous driving.

# LaneDetect-Road-Lane-Detection-System
LaneDetect is a Python-based project aimed at implementing road lane detection using OpenCV. This system serves as a crucial component of driver assistance systems, aiding in safer navigation by accurately identifying lane boundaries on roads.

# Features
## Lane Detection: Utilizes Canny edge detection and Hough transformation techniques to identify and extract lane markings from road images.
## Driver Assistance: Provides valuable information to driver assistance systems for lane keeping and lane departure warning functionalities.
## OpenCV Integration: Leveraging the power of OpenCV library for efficient image processing and computer vision tasks.
## Versatile Use: Can be integrated into both real-time video streams and static image processing pipelines.
## Easy to Use: Simple and intuitive Python API for easy integration into existing projects or applications.

# Installation
